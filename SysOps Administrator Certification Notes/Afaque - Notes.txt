1. Amazon RDS
RDS stands for Relational Database Service
• It’s a managed DB service for DB use SQL as a query language.
• It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS
• Postgres
• Oracle
• MySQL
• MariaDB
• Oracle
• Microsoft SQL Server
• Aurora (AWS Proprietary database)

2. RDS Read Replicas for read scalability
• Up to 5 Read Replicas
• Within AZ, Cross AZ or Cross Region

3. RDS Multi  AZ (Disaster Recovery)
• One DNS name – automatic app failover to standby
• Increase availability
• Failover in case of loss of AZ, loss of network, instance or storage failure

4. RDS Backups
• Backups are automatically enabled in RDS
• Automated backups:
• Daily full snapshot of the database
• Capture transaction logs in real time
• => ability to restore to any point in time
• 7 days retention (can be increased to 35 days)
• DB Snapshots:
• Manually triggered by the user
• Retention of backup for as long as you want

Notes:

1. Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. 

2. TTL (Time to Live). When we request for some address from Route 53 then we recieve an 
 address from the Route 53 with a TTL time. This TTL time is the time for which the address
 is cached in the client browser. After the TTL expires then if the client requires again then 
 the client will again request it again send a DNS request to Amazon Route 53

3. Amazon Routing Policies
a. Simple :- Maps a hostname to another hostname. Use when you need to redirect to a single resource.
             If multiple values are returned, a ranodm one is chosen by client.
b. Weighted:- It lets you associate multiple resources with a single domain name(example.com) or
              subdomain name(acme.example.com) and choose how much traffic is routed to each 
	      resources. This can be useful for variety of purposes, including load balancing and 
 	      testing new versions of software.

c. Latency-based routing:- If your application is hosted in multiple AWS Regions, you can improve 
               performance for your users by serving their requests from the AWS Region that 
               provides the lowest latency.
