Notes:
	AWS Cloud Practitioner exam requires skills and knowledge to effectively demonstrate and overall understanding of the AWS Cloud, independent of
	 specific technical roles. The certification exam can be taken at the test center or through online proctored exam.

	Cloud computing is the on demand delivery of IIT resources over the Internet with pay as you go price. Instead of buying online and 
	maintaining physical data centers and servers you can access the resources and services as needed from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services.

	Different types of cloud service providers are :- AWS,GCP, IBM Cloud etc.

	AWS offers a wide range of services for every business whether it is small or large, starting with basic elements, like compute, storage, and 
	network security tools, through complex solutions like blockchain, machine learning, or artificial intelligence, and robot development platforms,
	 all the way through very specialized tool sets, like video production management systems, and orbital satellites you can rent by the minute.

	What is Client Server Model?
•	In computing, a client can be a web browser or a desktop application that interact or make request to computer servers a server can be services 
	such as Amazon EC2 a type of virtual server.
 
	There are three types of cloud computing deployment models:
•	Cloud-Based Deployment
•	On-Premises Deployment
•	Hybrid Deployment
	Some Benefits of using cloud computing:
•	only pay for the computing resources you use instead of investing heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you are going to use them.
•	It gives the flexibility to focus less on running and maintaining data centers and focus more on the applications and customers.
•	Increase the speed and agility because we can you quickly develop and deploy applications.
•	We can get global and online in minutes.
	What is Devops ? 
•	Devops is the practice of operations and development engineers practicing together in the enter service life cycle from design through the 
	development process to production support.
	The idea behind using the devops is to reduce the latency that arises during the software development life cycle such as when a developer builts 
	an application and sends it for testing then the testing team does all the testing and may return with some errors. All of this process can take 
	some days or more. Which can lead to loss in business. Devops introduces a new practice where these development and operations team work together 
	allowing the flexibility to develop and test simultaneously and make the changes and improvise accordingly. which saves a lot of time.

Notes:

1. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud as Amazon EC2 instances.
 
2. Amazon EC2 instance types:-
	2.1 General Purpose Instance :- General purpose instances provide a balance of compute,memory and networking resources.
		We can use them for different purposes such as applications servers, gaming servers, backend servers for 
		enterprise applications, small and medium databases.
	2.2 Compute optimized instances :- Compute optimized instances are ideal for compute-bound applications that benefit from
		high-performance processors. Like general purpose instances, you can use compute optimized instances for worloads
		such as web, application and gaming servers.
	2.3 Memory optimized instances :- Memory optimized instances are designed to deliver fast performance for worloads that process large
		datasets in memory.
	2.4 Accelerated computing instances :- Accelerated computing instances use hardware accelerators, or coprocessors, to perform some 
		functions more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs. Examples of these functions include 
		graphics processing, and data pattern matching.
	2.5 Storage Optimized instances:- Storage optimized instances are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read 
		and write access to large datasets on local storage. Examples of workloads suitable for storage optimized instances
		 include distributed file systems, data warehousing applications.


3. Amazon EC2 Pricing :- With Amazon EC2, you pay only for the compute time that you use. Amazon EC2 offers a variety of pricing options 
	for different use cases.
	3.1 On-Demand :- On-Demand Instances are ideal for short-term, irregular workloads that cannot be interrupted. No upfront costs
		 or minimum contracts apply. The instances run continuously until you stop them, and you pay for only the compute time you use.
	3.2 Amazon EC2 Savings Plans :- AWS offers Savings Plans for several compute services, including Amazon EC2. Amazon EC2 Savings 
		Plans enable you to reduce your compute costs by committing to a consistent amount of compute usage for a 1-year or 3-year term.
		 This term commitment results in savings of up to 72% over On-Demand costs.
	3.3 Reserved Instances :- Reserved Instances are a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. 
		You can purchase Standard Reserved and Convertible Reserved Instances for a 1-year or 3-year term, and Scheduled 
		Reserved Instances for a 1-year term. You realize greater cost savings with the 3-year option.
	3.4 Spot Instances :- Spot Instances are ideal for workloads with flexible start and end times, or that can withstand interruptions.
		 Spot Instances use unused Amazon EC2 computing capacity and offer you cost savings at up to 90% off of On-Demand prices.
	3.5 Dedicated Hosts :- Dedicated Hosts are physical servers with Amazon EC2 instance capacity that is fully dedicated to your use. 

4. Scalability of EC2 :- AWS provides a special feature for scalability issues i.e Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling.

5. When you create an Auto Scaling group, you can set the minimum number of Amazon EC2 instances. The minimum capacity is the 
	number of Amazon EC2 instances that launch immediately after you have created the Auto Scaling group. In this example, the Auto Scaling group
 	has a minimum capacity of one Amazon EC2 instance.
	Next, you can set the desired capacity at two Amazon EC2 instances even though your application needs a minimum of a single Amazon EC2 instance to run.
	Remember If you do not specify the desired number of Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group, the desired capacity defaults to your minimum capacity.
	The third configuration that you can set in an Auto Scaling group is the maximum capacity. For example, you might configure the Auto Scaling group to 
	scale out in response to increased demand, but only to a maximum of four Amazon EC2 instances.

6. Elastic Load Balancer :- Elastic Load Balancing is the AWS service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple resources,
	 such as Amazon EC2 instances. 

7. A load balancer acts as a single point of contact for all incoming web traffic to your Auto Scaling group. This means that as you add or remove 
	Amazon EC2 instances in response to the amount of incoming traffic, these requests route to the load balancer first. Then, the requests spread across
	 multiple resources that will handle them. For example, if you have multiple Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing distributes the workload across
	 the multiple instances so that no single instance has to carry the bulk of it.

8. Monolithic Applications(Bad Approach for general purpose) :- Suppose that you have an application with tightly coupled components. These components might 
	include databases, servers, the user interface, business logic, and so on. This type of architecture can be considered a monolithic application. 
	In this approach to application architecture, if a single component fails, other components fail, and possibly the entire application fails.

9. Microservices(Good Approach for general purpose) :- In a microservices approach, application components are loosely coupled. In this case, if a 
	single component fails, the other components continue to work because they are communicating with each other. 
	The loose coupling prevents the entire application from failing. 
	To help maintain application availability when a single component fails, you can design your application through a microservices approach.

Notes:

* Availability Zones: group of logical data centers are known as Availability Zone. And each AWS Region consists of multiple,isolated and physically 
	separated availability zones within a geographical area. Availability Zones are located tens of miles apart from each other. This is close 
	enough to have them low latency between Availability Zones.

* When determining the right Region for your services, data, and applications, consider the following four business factors.
	* Compliance with data governance and legal requirements
	* Proximity to your customers
	* Available services within a Region
	* Pricing

* An edge location is a site that Amazon CloudFront uses to store cached copies of your content closer to your customers for faster delivery.

* Ways to interact with AWS Services
	* The AWS Management Console is a web-based interface for accessing and managing AWS services. You can quickly access recently used 
	  services and search for other services by name or keyword.
	* To save time when making API requests, you can use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). AWS CLI enables you to control 
	  multiple AWS services directly from the command line within one tool. By using AWS CLI, you can automate the actions that 
	  your services and applications perform through scripts.  


* AWS Elastic Beanstalk, you provide code and configuration settings, and Elastic Beanstalk deploys the resources necessary to perform the following tasks:
	* Adjust capacity
	* Load balancing
	* Automatic scaling
	* Application health monitoring

Notes:

* Amazon Virtual Private Cloud, A VPC lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a 
  virtual network that you define. These resources can be public facing so they have access to the internet, or private with no internet 
  access, usually for backend services like databases or application servers. 
	* To allow public traffic from the internet to access your VPC, you attach an internet gateway to the VPC.
	* To access private resources in a VPC, you can use a virtual private gateway. 

* AWS Direct Connect is a service that enables you to establish a dedicated private connection between your data center and a VPC.  

* A subnet is a section of a VPC in which you can group resources based on security or operational needs. Subnets can be public or private. 
	* Public subnets contain resources that need to be accessible by the public, such as an online store’s website.
	* Private subnets contain resources that should be accessible only through your private network, such as a database that
	  contains customers’ personal information.

* When a customer requests data from an application hosted in the AWS Cloud, this request is sent as a packet. A packet is a unit 
  of data sent over the internet or a network. 

* A network access control list (ACL) is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.
  Each AWS account includes a default network ACL. When configuring your VPC, you can use your account’s default network ACL 
  or create custom network ACLs. By default, your account’s default network ACL allows all inbound and outbound traffic, but
  you can modify it by adding your own rules. For custom network ACLs, all inbound and outbound traffic is denied until you 
  add rules to specify which traffic to allow. Additionally, all network ACLs have an explicit deny rule. This rule ensures 
  that if a packet doesn’t match any of the other rules on the list, the packet is denied. 

* Network ACLs perform stateless packet filtering. They remember nothing and check packets that cross the 
  subnet border each way: inbound and outbound. 

* A security group is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for an Amazon EC2 instance.
  By default, a security group denies all inbound traffic and allows all outbound traffic. You can add custom 
  rules to configure which traffic to allow or deny. If you have multiple Amazon EC2 instances within a subnet,
  you can associate them with the same security group or use different security groups for each instance. 

* Security groups perform stateful packet filtering. They remember previous decisions made for incoming packets.

* DNS resolution is the process of translating a domain name to an IP address. 

* Amazon Route 53 is a DNS web service. It gives developers and businesses a reliable way to route end users to
  internet applications hosted in AWS. Amazon Route 53 connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS. 
  It can route users to infrastructure outside of AWS.

* Another feature of Route 53 is the ability to manage the DNS records for domain names. You can register new 
  domain names directly in Route 53. You can also transfer DNS records for existing domain names managed by other 
  domain registrars. This enables you to manage all of your domain names within a single location.

Notes: 

* An instance store provides temporary block-level storage for an Amazon EC2 instance. An instance store is disk storage
  that is physically attached to the host computer for an EC2 instance, and therefore has the same lifespan as the instance.
  When the instance is terminated, you lose any data in the instance store.

* Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) is a service that provides block-level storage volumes that you can use with 
  Amazon EC2 instances. If you stop or terminate an Amazon EC2 instance, all the data on the attached EBS volume remains available.
  To create an EBS volume, you define the configuration (such as volume size and type) and provision it. After you create an 
  EBS volume, it can attach to an Amazon EC2 instance.

* An EBS snapshot is an incremental backup. This means that the first backup taken of a volume copies all the data. 
  For subsequent backups, only the blocks of data that have changed since the most recent snapshot are saved. 
  Incremental backups are different from full backups, in which all the data in a storage volume copies each 
  time a backup occurs. The full backup includes data that has not changed since the most recent backup.

* Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a service that provides object-level storage. 
  Amazon S3 stores data as objects in buckets.

* With Amazon S3, you pay only for what you use. You can choose from a range of storage classes to select
  a fit for your business and cost needs. When selecting an Amazon S3 storage class, consider these two factors:
	* How often you plan to retrieve your data
	* How available you need your data to be
* Different types of Amazon S3 storage classes:
	* S3 Standard
	* S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
	* S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
	* S3 Glacier
	* S3 Glacier Deep Archive

* DynamoDB is a database. It's a serverless database. DynamoDB stores this data redundantly across availability
  zones and mirrors the data across multiple drives under the hood for you. DynamoDB is massively scalable and
  also highly performant. DynamoDB has a millisecond response time. Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value database service.

Notes:

* The shared responsibility model divides into customer responsibilities and AWS responsibilities.

* Customers are responsible for the security of everything that they create and put in the AWS Cloud. When using AWS services,
  you, the customer, maintain complete control over your content. You are responsible for managing security requirements for 
  your content, including which content you choose to store on AWS, which AWS services you use, and who has access to that content.
  You also control how access rights are granted, managed, and revoked.

* AWS is responsible for security of the cloud. AWS operates, manages, and controls the components at all layers of infrastructure. 
  This includes areas such as the host operating system, the virtualization layer, and even the physical security of the data 
  centers from which services operate. 

* When you first create an AWS account, you begin with an identity known as the root user. It has complete access to all
  the AWS services and resources in the account.

* An IAM user is an identity that you create in AWS. It represents the person or application that interacts with AWS services
  and resources. It consists of a name and credentials. IAM policies enable you to customize users’ levels of access to resources.  

* least privilege principle states that you help to prevent users or roles from having more permissions than needed to perform their tasks.

* An IAM group is a collection of IAM users. When you assign an IAM policy to a group, all users in the group are granted 
  permissions specified by the policy.

* Multi-factor authentication :- You might have needed to provide your password and then a second form of authentication, 
  such as a random code sent to your phone. This is an example of multi-factor authentication.In IAM, multi-factor authentication
  (MFA) provides an extra layer of security for your AWS account.

* Hands on creating an IAM account.

* Hands-on - creating group and adding the user in it.

* Hands-on - changing IAM policies of the user.

Notes:

* This idea of observing systems, collecting metrics, evaluating those metrics over time, and then using them to make 
  decisions or take actions, is what we call monitoring. 

* It's important to set up monitoring in the cloud. With the elastic nature of AWS services that dynamically scale up
  and down, you'll want to keep a close pulse on your AWS resources to ensure that your systems are running as expected. 

* Amazon CloudWatch is a web service that enables you to monitor and manage various metrics and configure alarm actions 
  based on data from those metrics.CloudWatch uses metrics to represent the data points for your resources. AWS services
  send metrics to CloudWatch. CloudWatch then uses these metrics to create graphs automatically that show how 
  performance has changed over time. 

* With CloudWatch, you can create alarms that automatically perform actions if the value of your metric has gone above 
  or below a predefined threshold. 

* The CloudWatch dashboard feature enables you to access all the metrics for your resources from a single location. 
  You can even customize separate dashboards for different business purposes, applications, or resources.

* AWS CloudTrail records API calls for your account. The recorded information includes the identity of the API caller,
  the time of the API call, the source IP address of the API caller, and more. You can think of CloudTrail as a “trail”
  of breadcrumbs (or a log of actions) that someone has left behind them. With CloudTrail, you can view a complete 
  history of user activity and API calls for your applications and resources. 

* Events are typically updated in CloudTrail within 15 minutes after an API call. You can filter events by specifying 
  the time and date that an API call occurred, the user who requested the action, the type of resource that was 
  involved in the API call, and more.

* Events are typically updated in CloudTrail within 15 minutes after an API call. You can filter events by specifying
  the time and date that an API call occurred, the user who requested the action, the type of resource that was 
  involved in the API call, and more.

* AWS Trusted Advisor is a web service that inspects your AWS environment and provides real-time recommendations in 
  accordance with AWS best practices.

* Trusted Advisor compares its findings to AWS best practices in five categories: cost optimization, performance, 
  security, fault tolerance, and service limits. For the checks in each category, Trusted Advisor offers a list of
  recommended actions and additional resources to learn more about AWS best practices. 

* When you access the Trusted Advisor dashboard on the AWS Management Console, you can review completed checks for 
  cost optimization, performance, security, fault tolerance, and service limits.
  For each category:
  * The green check indicates the number of items for which it detected no problems.
  * The orange triangle represents the number of recommended investigations.
  * The red circle represents the number of recommended actions.
